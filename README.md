🏠 Blockchain-Based NFT Property Management System

A decentralized property management platform that uses Blockchain and NFTs to enable secure property buying, selling, and ownership transfer. Each property is represented as a Non-Fungible Token (NFT), ensuring transparency, immutability, and fraud-free transactions.

🚀 Project Overview

Traditional property transactions are:

Time-consuming

Paper-heavy

Prone to fraud and ownership disputes

This project solves these issues by leveraging Blockchain technology where:

Each property is minted as an NFT

Ownership records are stored on-chain

Transactions are transparent, secure, and tamper-proof

🎯 Objectives

Digitize property ownership using NFTs

Enable secure buying, selling, and transfer of properties

Eliminate intermediaries using smart contracts

Ensure transparency and trust in real estate transactions
